# UK-Based Income Streams Roadmap (Remote from Pakistan)

A step-by-step plan to build **UK-targeted** income streams using e-commerce, social platforms, affiliates, and GitHub for documentation and collaboration.

## Step 1 — Foundation
1. Ask your UK contact to open a **Shopify or Etsy** store and link a **UK bank account** for payouts.
2. Create a GitHub repo `uk-income-project` with folders:
   - `/products` (designs, mockups)
   - `/content` (Facebook posts, YouTube scripts)
   - `/affiliate` (links, banners)
   - `/ads` (marketing campaigns)
   - `/reports` (sales/ad summaries)

## Step 2 — Facebook Pages & Shops
1. Create a **UK-focused Facebook Business Page**.
2. Link the **Shop** section to Shopify/Etsy when ready.
3. Post product photos + **UK lifestyle/seasonal** content.
4. Run **UK-only** ad campaigns (**£3–5/day**).

## Step 3 — YouTube Channel
1. Create a **UK-targeted** channel with a clear niche.
2. Upload **2–3 videos/week**; store scripts in `/content/youtube`.
3. Add **UK affiliate links** in descriptions.

## Step 4 — Affiliate Marketing

2. Create content (blogs, FB posts, YouTube) with affiliate links.
